# Birche Online JS Client

The web client for my work-in-progress mmo.

# The Code

At the moment, the game is mostly just a tool to reach out and test the server I am building.

The client is written in React because that is what I am most used to. If I decide to go forward with a web client for the game, I will probably eventually migrate to a JavaScript game engine, likely Phaser, which I have worked with before, but I still have to look into it.

Eventually the "real" client will probably be a desktop application, built in Unity or maybe Unreal. But for now, a web client is much easier to develop and test quickly.
